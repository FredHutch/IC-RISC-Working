#### Version 0.7.1a (30 Aug 2017)
* minor changes to documentation

#### Version 0.7.0 (16 Aug 2017)
* all risk projections are now for 10 years rather than 5 years
* all comparison rates are now mortality-based rather than a mix of incidence and mortality.
For cancers with good survival (e.g., prostate, colon) the comparison rates will therefore be substantially lower
* EA rates have been updated to latest SEER release (2010 - 2015 diagnosis years)
* New menus separate risk factor information from other information

#### Version 0.6.1 (2 june 2017)
* confidence interval now takes into account uncertainty in calculating baseline hazard (via PAF) as well as an invidual's relative risk

#### Version 0.6.0 (5 may 2017)
* calculator now includes rates and risks for black males and white females (rates among black females is extremely low)
* incidence and mortality rates for comparison diseases have been updated to most recent available
* all comparison rates are now specific for age/sex/race group
* additional menu items have been added and consolidated uner "more information"
* risk factor information (relative risk and confidence interval) are now presented graphically
* EA incidence and overall mortality graphs are available by age/sex/race

#### Version 0.5.3 (21 feb 2017)
* color and numeric scales are now identical for SIM-positive and SIM-negative
* added up/down arrows for situations where estimated risk is beyond scale
* filling of circles for dot plot now begins in upper left

#### Version 0.5.2 (7 feb 2017)
* added confidence band (preliminary calculation)
* modified default smoking status to "ever smoker"

#### Version 0.5.1 (7 dec 2016)
* changed color of SIM-positive thermometer to match SIM-negative, but extend to brighter yellows
* added statins to prevention section
* changed "clinical" wording to "screening results" 
* use negative/positive/unknown as options for SIM status
(currently SIM negative and SIM unknown yield same result - this is under review)
* change default SIM segment length from zero cm to 2 cm

#### Version 0.5.0 (5 nov 2016)
* modified calculation of 5-year esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence to account for competing risks (as per Gail, 1989)
* changed appearance of thermometer and risk marker (for simplicity)

#### Version 0.4.2 (29 sep 2016)
* converted smoking pack-years to ever/never (for simplicity)
* rearranged groups of factors
* added physical acivity calculator

#### Version 0.4.1 (15 sep 2016)
* added progress bar
* added footnotes to thermometer

#### Version 0.4.0 (14 sep 2016)
* added 3rd column for input data
* shortened thermometer to better fit on wide/short windows such as laptops
* added beginnings of help system
* added "what's new" tab
