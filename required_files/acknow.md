#### Acknowledgments
There are many individuals who helped develop and shape IC\-RISC(TM), and I am grateful to all. These include Lynn Onstad, James Dai and Li Hsu at Fred Hutch (http://fredhutch.org) who offered guidance and programming support for estimating risk and confidence intervals while accounting for competing mortality; Patty Galipeau, also at Fred Hutch, who suggested many usability improvements; and members of the BEACON consortium (http://beacon.tlvnet.net) and CISNET esophageal network (https://cisnet.cancer.gov/esophagus/) who offered helpful advice at multiple points during its development.
